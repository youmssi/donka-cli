Donka — decision management for credit and risk teams.

Use this tool when the user asks about rules, business rules, rules generation, extracting logic into rules, or anything related to decision management.

WORKFLOW: The first tool to call is **get_system_context** to get instructions, available tools, and information about Donka.

HTTP ENDPOINTS:
The bridge exposes REST endpoints for local development (port defaults to 41919).

POST /evaluate/{filePath} — evaluate a decision graph
Example: POST http://localhost:41919/evaluate/my-decision
Body: { "context": { "customer": { "tier": "premium" }, "orderTotal": 150 } }
Response: { "result": { "discount": 0.15, "freeShipping": true } }
Optional body fields: "trace" (boolean)

GET /file/{filePath} — retrieve a decision file as JSON
Example: GET http://localhost:41919/file/my-decision
Response: returns the raw decision graph JSON

These endpoints can be used as a loader for ZenEngine:
const engine = new ZenEngine({ loader: async (key) => (await fetch(`http://localhost:41919/file/${key}`)).json() })
